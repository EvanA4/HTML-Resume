Why am I making this?
As I've been developing a digital footprint, trying to introduce what few coding skills I have to the world, I have been prompted time and time again across several websites about any personal website I might have. I've left this blank every time because I don't know how to code much of a website. So, over the next six weeks of Winter break, I will try to create the best website-esc resume possible.
