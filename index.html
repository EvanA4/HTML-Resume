                <p>I am a calm, shy, and yet curious introvert who loves learning. Some say I have a dry but witty sense of humor. I have always cherished creativity, as I feel this is a
                    very important to problem solving. Problem solving and strategizing is one of my hobbies, and I would describe myself as an analytical person. Actually, I was origionally planning on
                    becoming a clinical psychologist in high school.</p>
                <p>When I have free time, I usually try to play games online with my friends, work on coding projects, or create digital art. I try to always have a creative outlet handy,
                    whether this sketching on a worksheet from one of my classes, or using a digital art software installed on my computer (I have found Medibang Paint Pro is good and
                    free). Occasionally, I like to meet with friends in person, go on hiking trips in the mountains, or even eat out.</p>
                <p>I love drawing and any form of it. Recently, I have even enjoyed writing short stories; my style is largely inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien. Obviously, I love coding
                    and learning how things work. I have always loved seeing tiny details come together to create something greater than the sum of its parts, the heart of
                    engineering. Lately, I have been dabbling in chess (still terrible, mind you). My long-time favorite food has been spaghetti, and my favorite animal is the Green
                    Sea Turtle.</p>

            <div class="row1">
                <p>My high school unweighted and weighted GPA was 3.90 and 4.51, respectively. I am at least in the top ten percent of my high school. I have long been fascinated with the STEM
                    Ô¨Åeld, acquiring A's in classes like AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism, AP Physics C: Mechanics, AP Biology, AP Chemistry, AP Calculus AB, and AP Calculus
                    BC. Other than two classes at Farragut High School, I have only received A's. Now that I am in college, I am a part of the Chancellor's Honors and Cook Grand Challenge Honors Program at UTK.
                    <br><br><span style="margin-left:2em"></span>I was a member of the National Honors Society of my high school for my sophomore, junior, and senior year,
                    raking in over 60 hours of community service (not including serving in Scouts of America).</p>

                <p>I served as a general team member at McDonalds for the month of July 2021, and it was a fast-paced work environment taking 40 hours a week. Moreover, I am
                    currently working as a host in Chili's and started in July 2022. As a result, I've learned teamwork and communication skills, and have become familiar to
                    the professional work environment.

                <p>I was a boy scout for 6 years of my childhood, and I have the Eagle Scout badge to show for it. I was constantly learning new things and challening myself
                    to become smarter everyday. I met some of my closest friends there.</p>

                            <h2>Python</h2>
                            <p><span style="margin-left:2em"></span>Python was my first ever language and was what hooked me into computer science to begin with. I have learned
                                up to polymorphism and flow-control in this language. I have coded 2048 in my spare time. I also have experience in PyQt, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
                                <br><br><span style="margin-left:2em"></span>I had a research opportunity in the summer of 2022 (before I was a freshmen in college) which analyzed
                                the accuracy of a facial detection AI on increasingly distorted images. I helped design the GUI of the project using PyQt (this included a default
                                button, error windows, and the occasional touch-up.</p>

                            <h2>C++</h2>
                            <p><span style="margin-left:2em"></span>C++ is my most familiar language at the moment. Just like Python and Java, I understand everything up to
                                polymorphism and flow control; however, I also have experience creating data structures and algorithms. This includes unordered maps, linked
                                lists, sets, binary trees, binary search trees, and more. I coded a program which would take any sized matrix from the user and convert it
                                into reduced row echelon form. It's actually on my GitHub!</p>

                            <h2>Java</h2>
                            <p><span style="margin-left:2em"></span>Java was my second programming language, and I can write polymorphic code using flow control. I have actually
                                taken two classes on this programming language. In my high school class, we wrote our own video games using an obscure coding platform known as
                                GreenFoot. It was a 2-dimensional side-scroller.</p>

                            <h2>Lua</h2>
                            <p><span style="margin-left:2em"></span>Lua is my weakest language, and I have not had the time to learn much about class syntax, not to mention
                                inheritance and polymorphism. Regardless, I use Lua to play a modded version of Minecraft called ComputerCraft: Tweaked; it involves programmable
                                computers! I highly recommend it.</p>

                            <h2>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h2>
                            <p><span style="margin-left:2em"></span>Web development has been very fun to learn, and these languages are just as familiar to me as C++. If you are
                                hoping to see my most technical web development project, look no further! This website took me a while to code, and I have learned a lot in the
                                process. I am most proud of the parallax and breathing effect of the gradient behind these cards.</p>
