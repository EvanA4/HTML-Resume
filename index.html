                <h1>Q: What happened to the previous website?</h1>
                <p>A: Well... the last website had a lot of problems with it. Although it had some interesting JavaScript,
                    it felt clunky and had bugs which killed the aesthetic. I realized I thought it looked pretty ugly, too.
                    There was also very little reactivity to the website size, meaning phone users were looking at a horrific
                    website when held verticle. The design was not expandable at all, either. Here, I can easily grow my site
                    as I complete more projects.</p>

                <h1>Academics</h1>
                <p>My high school unweighted and weighted GPA was 3.90 and 4.51, respectively. I was at least in the top
                    ten percent of my high school. I have recieved A's in classes
                    like AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism, AP Physics C: Mechanics, AP Biology, AP Chemistry, AP Calculus
                    AB, and AP Calculus BC. Other than two classes at Farragut High School, I have only received A's.</p>
                <p>Now that I am in college, I am a part of the Chancellor's Honors and Cook Grand Challenge Honors Program
                    at UTK. I've gotten A's in CS101, CS102, EF157, and EF158. I feel quite comfortable with the pace of my current
                    classes, as I practice programming outside of class a bit.</p>

                <h1>SULI Internship at ORNL</h1>
                <p>Albiet a little intimidating at first, I learned quite a bit here (summer of 2023). Here's some of the things I learned:</p>
                <div class="bullets">
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Intermediate C++ and Python</p></li>
                        <li><p>Created a point cloud object recognition pipeline</p></li>
                        <li><p>Learned how to give short and sweet updates at meetings</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Practiced GitHub and GitLab</p></li>
                        <li><p>Coded as a teammember</p></li>
                        <li><p>Reviewed machine learning and artificial intelligence</p></li>

            <div class="item" id="Unpaid Internship">
                <h1>Unpaid Internship</h1>
                <p>My first ever experience with GitHub. Dr. Mongi Abidi was willing to let me play around with his graduate
                    student's facial recognition code (summer of 2022). I learned how to create GUIs with PyQT Creator, but
                    this was also the time I became fascinated with machine learning. I learned basic Python, as well.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="item" id="Private Projects">
                <h1>My Own Projects</h1>
                <p>Here's a description of some projects I'm proud of because they were complicated, unique, or both:</p>
                <div class="bullets">
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>A Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) calculator for any matrix. This used basic C++ programming, but the logic itself
                            was rather complicated!
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p>Two resume websites. These do take some time to make, although this one was simpler and quicker to produce. No JavaScript
                            required!
                        </p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Simulating a randomly selected stock portfolio. A bot would occasionally buy a stock with virtual money. Matplotlib was
                            used to display the results over time. It failed horribly, but that's probably because I didn't use a goldfish.
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p>Animal Crossing: New Horizions turnip command terminal. This terminal allowed one to store turnip prices in long and
                            short-term storage. The short term data could be compared with the long term data using Matplotlib, helping one determine
                            when to sell their turnips. It's niche, but I loved coding it and may even upload it to GitHub.
                        </p></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="item" id="Future Plans">
                <h1>Future Plans</h1>
                <p>I hope to achieve a 5-year master's degree in computer science and persue artificial intelligence. I've found web development pretty 
                    cool, too, so I'm happy doing either. If I do not recieve other job offers before this upcoming summer, I'll probably be heading
                    back to ORNL to continue working on point cloud object recognition.
